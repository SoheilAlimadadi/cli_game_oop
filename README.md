# Dungeon and Dragons OOP - v.1.0.0

1: poetry install
2: alembic upgrade head
3: alembic stamp head
4 : python3 run.py (have fun!, you might also need to have special fonts installed for the emojis to work)

## Abstraction

(this project was only tested on macbook)

In this version of DnD once the player runs main.py, player can either login or 
register or quit.
After logging in, player can either start the game with a the preferred
difficulty, see the leaderboard or logout.
Once you start the game:

- the player can get out of the game with 'q'
- Move up, down, right andleft with "up", "down", "right", "left"
- shoot up, down, right and left with 'shoot up', 'shoot down' and so on.

if player gets next to the dragon horizontally or vertically, player will lose
one of the healths shown under the map with 'ðŸ’œ'.

if player uses the shoot command, the next 2 cell in that direction will get on
fire and if player shoots at the walls, they get destroyed and if player shoots
at the dragons, dragon will die.
player can even teleport through the map horizontally if he destroys one of the
side walls of the map but he/she can not do the same with top and bottom walls.
